#Webpack JS starter kit
This isn't anything too crazy, just have node installed, and this should do the rest :)

Prerequisites
* Node

##Installation
If you're just starting out, go ahead and install Node.js on your system <https://nodejs.org/>.
Then install Yarn globally (because it's better than NPM... In my opinion).

```
npm i -g yarn
```
